          <p>
              Hi, I&#39;m David Kan, a second-year student at the University of Georgia persuing a B.S. in Computer Science,
              a Minor in Business and a Financial Technology (FinTech) Certificate. I&#39;ve gained hands-on experience in
              AI and machine learning through research internships, where I worked on projects like mental disorder
              classification using EEG data and model optimization with image classification. These experiences have
              inspired me to pursue a career where I can apply AI to solve problems and create solutions. In addition
              to my technical pursuits, I&#39;m actively involved in organizations like the Terry Fintech Society where I&#39;m
              exploring the intersection of technology and business. I’m excited about opportunities to grow in AI, but
              I’m also eager to explore other areas of computer science to gain a broader understanding of how different
              fields interact, allowing me to build a strong foundation for creating innovative solutions.
